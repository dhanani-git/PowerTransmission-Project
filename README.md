# Fault-Classification-in-Transmission-Lines-using-Machine-Learning
â€”Faults in power transmission lines or grids can
arise from various sources such as adverse weather conditions,
animal interference, or equipment failure. Timely and accurate
detection of these faults is important for maintaining a reliable
and continuous power supply. This exploratory project aims to
develop a model capable of detecting and classifying faults in
a three-phase power supply system based on input values of
currents and voltages provided by the user. We explore both
conventional and modern fault detection techniques. Traditional
physical methods include the Terminal Method, which utilizes
bridge techniques with resistors to detect faults from one or both
cable ends, and Drone Aerial Photography, used primarily for
visual inspection of insulators. On the technical side, advanced
approaches include Voltage/Current Threshold Monitoring and
the application of machine learning algorithms for automated
fault classification. In this project, we employ various machine
learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support
Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random
Forest to identify and categorize the types of faults, if any, in the
transmission line. The results aim to improve the fault detection
process, making it more accurate and less reliant on manual
inspection.
